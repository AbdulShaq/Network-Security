DNS Detect Explanation:

    For my DNS Detect program I had to be able to look at multiple packets and 
    hold them since my spoofed might come before the real response or if its a bit
    slow it will come after it anf if another request is made before my spoofed response
    showed up it would be between the 2 responses so I have to hold multiple reponse packets
    and compare them until I find 2 responses that share a qname a and DNS ID and since
    I know my packets and structed to have the source ports and destenation ports switched
    compared the real response and same for the IP source and destenation. Also if it doesnt
    have a DNS response field I just would Ignore it since that would be a request packet 
    and wouldnt be needed to check. I then had the issue with where the order of the packets
    came whether it was the spoofed packet first or the real request packet first,
    so it would sometimes write the spoofed address as answer 1 and the legit one as
    answer 2. So to fix that before I ignore a request packet I save its source IP
    because based on my spoofed packets I know that the request packets source IP
    matched the spoofed packets source IP, I would then know how to structure the write
    data to attack_log.txt so that the legit IP is for answer 1 and the fake IP for answer 2.
    Then I would access the packets timestamp and format the data to show in the proper format
    and the packets DNS ID and format it to hex value and the DNS qname so I can write that
    information to the attack_log.txt as well.
