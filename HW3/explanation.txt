DNS Injection Explanation:

    For my DNS inject program I first had to understand what a DNS request looked like and
    what a DNS response looked like. I started by just using dig to make DNS traffic then 
    I would use sniff to catch DNS packets then I would print the packets using .show().
    I analyized the 2 packets to see how they look and differ. Then I tried to construct my
    fake packet off of the legitement reponse packet as it came in, then scan the traffic using
    wireshark. I came to realize this way would always result in my spoofed packet coming in
    secoond to the real one, since I would read the reponse as it came in. So I decieded to
    capture the request and make my reponse so that there could be the chance they my packet 
    arrived first (which it did on occasion). At first wireshark would not catch my packets 
    if I tried making it exactly like the reponse, for example if I made the requests source
    IP my packets destenation IP and my Packets source packet the requests destenation it 
    would not catch it, but if I flipped them it would and wireshark would flag it as a 
    response to the DNS request packet. Then when it came to poisoning the hostnames given
    I would put the hostname with its corresponding spoof IP into a dictionary then check
    if the request packet I was scanning was requesting for that site then Id inject my 
    spoofed response with its poisoned address. If not list was given I pulled the systems
    IP and used that for every packet.Other than that I tried to mimic everythingelse exactly 
    as the response packet would. I also setup a Virtualenv in python while testing my code. 
    An issue I ran into in the begining was that even though I had scapy installed and imported
    scapy.all, my code wouldnt recoginze things like IP or UDP unless I imported it directly.
