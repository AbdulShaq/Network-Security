Task A analysis:

Legit DNS responses usually are longer in length and they carry more additional
records. Also In my injection.pcap the legit DNS responses had a few ways they 
differedfrom the spoofed ones. For example the IP sources and destenations were 
flipped from each other and same for the destenation and source ports. The 
real response also had more athority answers than the fake since the real one
actually got authenticated on its path. but things like the DNS ID ,the Opcode
values and ancount stayed the same. There are some values that are expected for
certain fields so they can be copied such as QR where responses are 1, but others
arent so definite such as the athority answer which depends on the host sending the
response since this is the most important field since it specifies that this response
is from an athority from the source.
