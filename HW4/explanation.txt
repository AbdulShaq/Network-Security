I did not have much time for this assignment due to many of my classes slamming me with projects and exams, so I did not finish everything. For this assignment I decided to use sockets to build a connection between user and proxy and then proxy and web server and then try to scan the requests/responses as they went back and forth. I used regex's to analyze the requests to find the personal info I needed and saved it to a text file. I also tried to start with the active attack by breaking down the request to see if the targeted domain matches or not. I also created a simple phishing login html page but didn't get to put the active part of it together. Please show kindness while grading its been a rough 2-3 weeks for me.}
